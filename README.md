KushAmI - track your (my) sneezes with a neural network. The impractical, over-engineered solution you never thought you'd kinda want to know a little about.

Some handy tools such as `augment_audio.py` for data augmentation so you don't need to record your sneezes for years to collect enough data.

There's also `reconstruct_audio_from_spectrogram.py` which will be used to peek into the layers/neurons within the model to "hear" the training and classification process. Neat!
